The technologies I used in this application are as below

<h1>1-MVVM</h1

<ul>
  <li> MVVM provides ease of testing and maintenance by avoiding the tight link between Model and View. </li>

  <li> It is widely used in large and complex applications and includes features such as data binding and event routing. </li>
 
  <li> This is a design pattern that aims to increase user interface orientation and code reusability.</li>
</ul>
