The technologies I used in this application are as below

<h1>1-MVVM</h1
<ul>
  <li> MVVM provides ease of testing and maintenance by avoiding the tight link between Model and View. </li>
  <li> It is widely used in large and complex applications and includes features such as data binding and event routing. </li>
  <li> This is a design pattern that aims to increase user interface orientation and code reusability.</li>
</ul>

<h1>2-Retrofit</h1>
<ul>
  <li>  Retrofit is a library that greatly simplifies managing HTTP requests in Android applications.. </li>
  <li>   This allows you to easily communicate with RESTful APIs and includes automatic Gson integration for data transformations. </li>
  <li>    Retrofit provides a generic structure for API calls, so our code becomes cleaner and easier to maintain. </li>
</ul>


<h1>3-Hilt</h1
<ul>
  <li>Hilt is a library that greatly simplifies dependency injection in Android applications. </li>
  <li>Using Hilt, you can automatically manage dependencies and easily create connections between classes. </li>
  <li>This makes our code more readable and easier to maintain, speeding up the application development process. </li>
</ul>

<h1>4-Navigation Component</h1
<ul>
  <li>It simplifies navigation management in Android applications and makes it easier to switch between different screens of the application. </li>
</ul>

<h1>5-ViewBinding</h1>
<ul>
  <li>It allows you to access views in XML files more safely and effectively, thus reducing the possibility of making mistakes and making our code more readable. </li>
</ul>
